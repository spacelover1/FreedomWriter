تو [این فیلم](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10986222/) شخصیت اصلی ینی Joaquin Phoenix با بچه ها درباره آینده و افکارشون مصاحبه می کنه. مثل همیشه چند تا از دیالوگ های فیلم رو میذارم. این دیالوگ ها اکثرا صحبت بجه های توی فیلمه.



    So my fear is loneliness, and people not understanding you even though they're there to understand  
    you. It's just really scary  cause feels like you have no one.

--------------------------

    She says: Even though we love each other. She'll never know everything about me and I'll never  
    know everything about her. It's just the way it is.

--------------------------

    "Have you ever thought about future?"
    "Oh, yeah. Whatever you plan on happening, never happens. Stuff you would never think of happens  
    So you just have to come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on..."

    'Kids tend to think freely. Adults when they think, they think in a tight space.'

    "Motherhood is the place in our culture where we bury our conflicts and what it means to be fully  
    human. Mothers are scapegoats for personal and political failings and for everything that is wrong  
    in the world. In doing this, we blind ourselves to the world’s iniquities.  
    What are we doing to our mothers and we expect them to carry the burden of everything that is hard  
    as to contemplate about our society and ourselves. Mothers cannot help but be in touch with the  
    most difficult aspects of any fully lived life. Why on earth should've fault them to paint things  
    bright and innocent and safe?"

    "Over the years, you will try to make sense of that happy, sad, full, empty, always shifting life  
    you're in. And when the time comes to return to your star, it may be hard to say goodbye to that  
    strangely beautiful world."
