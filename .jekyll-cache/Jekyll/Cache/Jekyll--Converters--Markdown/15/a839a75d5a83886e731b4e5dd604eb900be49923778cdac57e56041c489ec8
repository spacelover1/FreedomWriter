You thought I was gonna be long dead before that, didnt you?
Alex:Well, not everyone makes it through, I gave you that. 
But you've got a shot,
for now enjoy the moment. Give yourself time, Anna. The play's in your favor.
Let the current move beneath you, powers will shift, enemies can vanish,

Alex Tchenkov: I think youâ€™ve made the wrong decision.

Alex Tchenkov: You have a right to make your own choices in your life.
Go here, go there. Say yes, say no. But what you canâ€™t do is reject life itself.
Your life was a gift. Who gave it to you?
Anna: My parents.
Alex Tchenkov: And this is how you honor them? This is what your father would
