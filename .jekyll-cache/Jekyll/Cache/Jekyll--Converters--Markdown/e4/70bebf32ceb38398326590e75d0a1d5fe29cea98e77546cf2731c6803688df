are still capable of suffocating us

Improve your dancing, practice a lot, and set a very high goal,

achieves it has failed in life.

You get married-- even if he is the worst man in the world-- 
just so that others cant say no one wants you. You have children, 
grow old, and spend the end of your days watching passersby 
from a chair on the sidewalk, pretending to know everything about life 
yet unable to silence the voice in your heart that says: 
"You could try something else."

And yet the exact opposite was taking place: My tears were healing me.
At times I punched my fists into the gravel beach and my hands bleed, 
but I didn't even feel the pain. I was being healed. 
I understood why Catholics confess even though they must know priests 
share the same sins of worst. It did not matter who was listening 
what mattered was leaving the wound open for the sun to purify 
and the rainwater to wash. 
That is what I was doing now in front of a man with whom 
I had no intimacy that was the real reason i was able to speak so freely.
