<p>یکی از جملاتی که راس تو سریال Friends گفت:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>By the year 2030, there will be computers that can carry out 
the same amount of functions as an actual human brain, 
So, theoretically, you can download your thoughts and memories 
into this computer and live forever as a machine." Nov - 1999
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>و این هم برگی از سخنان جفری هینتون:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"My belief is that we’re not going to get human-level abilities
until we have systems that have the same number of parameters
in them as the brain. So in the brain, you have connections 
between the neurons called synapses, and they can change. 
All your knowledge is stored in those synapses. You have about
1,000-trillion synapses—10 to the 15, it’s a very big number. 
So that’s quite unlike the neural networks we have right now. 
They’re far, far smaller, the biggest ones we have right now 
have about a billion synapses. That’s about a million times 
smaller than the brain.” - Geoffrey Hinton Mar 18, 2016


Q: Do you dare predict a timeline for that?

A: More than five years. I refuse to say anything beyond five years
because I don’t think we can see much beyond five years.
